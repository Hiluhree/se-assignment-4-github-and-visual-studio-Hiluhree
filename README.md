# SE-Assignment-4
Assignment: GitHub and Visual Studio
Instructions:
Answer the following questions based on your understanding of GitHub and Visual Studio. Provide detailed explanations and examples where appropriate.

# Questions:
## 1. Introduction to GitHub:
#### What is GitHub, and what are its primary functions and features? Explain how it supports collaborative software development.
GitHub is a platform that makes use of Git for version control on the internet. It offers developers a place to store, record, and keep track of changes made to their code repositories which are used in software development. 
Some important features of the github are; 
 - Repositories - These are working areas or consumer-oriented structures that give different programmers access to common information through their own subsets or profiles;
 - Branching and Merging enables developers work on various aspects of a project at once;
 - Pull Requests allow for feedback and possible improvements before incorporating modifications into a document or a file at large.
 - Offers tools for tracking tasks, bugs and project progress available in issues and project management
 - Automates workflows like CI/CD in GitHub Actions
 - Projects can be followed by developers through a feature called social coding
 - `GitHub supports collaborative software development by allowing multiple developers to work on the same project simultaneously, manage changes, review each other's code, and automate workflows.`

## 2. Repositories on GitHub:
#### What is a GitHub repository? Describe how to create a new repository and the essential elements that should be included in it.
- A repository on GitHub is a place for settling a projectâ€™s files including code and documentation, keeping in mind that it archives changes that are made to these files over time.

- To create a new repository:
  - Sign in to GitHub and navigate to the main page.
  - Click the '+' icon in the upper-right corner and select "New repository."
  - Fill in the repository name and optional description.
  - Choose the visibility (public or private).
  - Initialize the repository with a README, .gitignore, and license if needed.
  - Click "Create repository."
- Essential elements:
  - README.md: Provides an overview of the project.
  - .gitignore: Specifies which files should be ignored by Git.
  - LICENSE: Defines the legal permissions for using the project.
  - Source Code Files: The actual code of the project.
  - Documentation: Additional guides or manuals related to the project.
    
## 3. Version Control with Git:
#### Explain the concept of version control in the context of Git. How does GitHub enhance version control for developers?
  - Version control is used to keep a chronological record of modifications made to a file to enable retrieval of specific versions later. Git which is distributed allows software developers to handle modifications o such multiple branches as well as stores where they are housed.
  - GitHub improves version control through the following ways:
       i. By hosting of git repositories found on line making it possible for anyone to get them.
       ii. Through provision of visual interface for Git commands which simplifies everything.
       iii. Through pull requests, code reviews and comments enabling collaboration taking place between developers.
       iv. By integration with tools and services regarding CI/CD, project management among others.
   
## 4. Branching and Merging in GitHub:
#### What are branches in GitHub, and why are they important? Describe the process of creating a branch, making changes, and merging it back into the main branch.
  - Branches are separate versions of a repository allowing developers to work on them without altering the primary codebase. They are vital for coordinating multiple features or bug fixes at once.
  - Process:
    - Create a Branch: `git checkout -b new-feature`
    - Make Changes: Modify files and commit changes.
      - `git add .`
      - `git commit -m "Add new feature"`
    - Push the Branch to GitHub
      - `git push origin new-feature`
    - Create a Pull Request: Open a pull request on GitHub to merge changes.
    - Review and Merge: After review, merge the branch into the main branch
      - `git checkout main`
      - `git merge new-feature`
      - `git push origin main`
   
## 5. Pull Requests and Code Reviews:
#### What is a pull request in GitHub, and how does it facilitate code reviews and collaboration? Outline the steps to create and review a pull request.
- A PR (pull request) is a feature found on GitHub that makes it possible for developers to notify their team members before pushing changes to branches for more efficient code review and discussion before merging into master branch.
- Steps to create and review a pull request:
  - Push changes to a branch on GitHub.
  - Navigate to the repository on GitHub.
  - Click the "Pull requests" tab and then "New pull request."
  - Select the branch with your changes and the base branch.
  - Fill in the PR details: Title, description, and assign reviewers.
  - Submit the PR for review.
  - Reviewers provide feedback and request changes if necessary.
  - Author makes revisions and updates the PR.
  - Reviewers approve the PR.
  - Merge the PR into the main branch.
    
## 6. GitHub Actions:
#### Explain what GitHub Actions are and how they can be used to automate workflows. Provide an example of a simple CI/CD pipeline using GitHub Actions.
- GitHub Actions is a Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment service which automates software workflows directly within GitHub repositories utilizing YAML syntax to create workflows.
- Example of a simple CI/CD pipeline:
  - `name: CI`
  - `on: [push]`
  - `jobs:`
   - `build:`

     - `runs-on: ubuntu-latest`

    - `steps:`
     - `name: Checkout code`
       - `uses: actions/checkout@v2`

    - `name: Set up Node.js`
      `uses: actions/setup-node@v2`
      `with:`
        `node-version: '14'`

    - `name: Install dependencies`
      `run: npm install`

    - `name: Run tests`
      `run: npm test`
